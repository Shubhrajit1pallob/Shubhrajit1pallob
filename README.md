## Hi there 👋

I am **Shubhrajit Pallob**, a Software Engineer based in the United States.

My primary focus is on DevOps, but I am also proficient in the entire software lifecycle, encompassing development, testing, and the efficient deployment of code to production. I possess a strong foundation in Software Development processes and Design, complemented by self-developed expertise in applying modern DevOps principles to ensure the seamless deployment and operation of software.

I have extensive hands-on practice using the cloud and building Cloud Infrastructure and Automation. Recently, I have dabbled in GitOps as I build and expand my Kubernetes Homelab.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on...

  I'm on the verge of graduating this December! Currently, my major project is designing and building my very own Kubernetes home server.

  In short, here's a system that needs to be designed and shipped into production. I'm your guy!
